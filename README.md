C++ virtual file system shell
_______________________________

This project is a virtual file system shell written in C++. It simulates a Linux style terminal that lets the user navigate directories, create and delete folders and files, read and write file contents, view a tree style structure, and save/load the entire virtual file system. All actions happen inside a virtual environment stored in memory and the system saves everything to a text file called vfs.txt so the structure can be restored between program runs.

The project also demonstrates object-oriented programming, tree structures, recursion, file I/O, and command parsing with C++. It also shows a simple but functional example of how a shell interacts with a file system and how these concepts can be implemented in a controlled virtual environment.
